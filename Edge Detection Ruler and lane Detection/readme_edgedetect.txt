These scripts demonstrate basic functions
of edge detection.  The ruler images are
first converted to greyscale using color plane
extraction.  

Edge Detector is used to detect both edges of 
the ruler and caliper is used to measure
the width and midpoint.


Lane Detection was done using Find Straight
Edge function.  The bounding box was rotated
and extended to detect the lanes.
