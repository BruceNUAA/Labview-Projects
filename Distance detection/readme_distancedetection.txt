This project detects a circle using 
vision express.  

It uses continous acquisition with
inline processing option to get the
images.

A Range Detection Script was added to
the vision assistant to process the
image and detect the circle properly.

Shape Detection was used to detect the 
actual circle.  

A subvi (Overlay Circle) was added to
to show the overlay on the circle detected.
